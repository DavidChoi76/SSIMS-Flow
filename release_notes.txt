SSIMS-Flow v0.4.1.3

Minor:
- Buxfix when 2D plots cause a "file not found" error with older projects
(pre v0.4.0.0) due to missing threshold_ratios.txt

===============================================================================

SSIMS-Flow v0.4.1.2

Minor:
- Fixed error in Preview filters

===============================================================================

SSIMS-Flow v0.4.1.1

Minor:
- Optical flow analysis will now show an overlay of the image used for
velocity estimation and the flow magnitude field, so that the user can track
what is being detected and tracked.
- Added support for taskbar progress indicator using PyTaskbar.
Requires comtypes (install with pip), and PyGetWindow (install with pip).
Is not required if you don't want/need a taskbar progress indicator.
Credits for PyTaskbar go to N3RDIUM (https://github.com/N3RDIUM/PyTaskbar).

===============================================================================

SSIMS-Flow v0.4.1.0

Major:
- Added an option to choose frame pairing method:
    a) Sliding frames by step (0>>step, step>>2*step, ...) = faster, less data
    b) Sliding frames by one (0>>step, 1>>step+1, ...) = slower, but more data

Minor:
- Improved background removal filter
- Modified filter preview form

===============================================================================

SSIMS-Flow v0.4.0.1

Minor:
- Bugfixes: colorspace conversions
- HSV colorspace now uses full 0-255 range for Hue, instead of 0-179

===============================================================================

SSIMS-Flow v0.4.0.0

Major:
- Reworked Image enhancement form, now opens in a new window with preview
- Image enhancement preview now uses native .NET forms, instead of Matplotlib.
This now allows for real-time preview of filter effects from the Enhance frames
form, without the need to restart Matplotlib figure every time.
- Optical flow now processes frames in pairs of (0, 0+OF_step), (1, 1+OF_step),
etc., where OF_step is the optical flow step. Previous versions used logic of
(0, OF_step), (OF_step, 2*OF_step), etc., which leads to fewer data points
in the final results.
- Added options to save filter stack to a file and load them from a file. This
should make it easier to reuse filter stacks across different projects, but
also allows for easier sharing with other people.

Minor:
- Minor bugfixes

===============================================================================

SSIMS-Flow v0.3.3.0

Major:
- Added Crop-to-ROI option in Unpack videos form
- Added Adjust Channels filter
- Required vcruntime140.dll now shipped with DLLs

Minor:
- Added a post-filtering colorspace indicator to the Enhance frames form.
Filter definitions now contain additional ColorspaceAfter parameter.
- Added a MEAN parameter to Gaussian lookup filter (previously fixed at 127)
- Apparently some changes were made to the way objects can be deleted in
Matplotlib 3.7+, causing deletion of certain object to fail. Should now
work correctly.

===============================================================================

SSIMS-Flow v0.3.2.1

Minor:
- Fixed bugs with global histogram equalization and CLAHE for multi-channel
inputs

===============================================================================

SSIMS-Flow v0.3.2.0

===============================================================================

SSIMS-Flow v0.3.1.2

Minor:
- Fixed a bug with Channel Thresholding Filter

===============================================================================

SSIMS-Flow v0.3.1.1

Minor:
- Recompiled ssim.dll with MSVCR140.dll, now same as pooling.dll and filtering.dll
to remove dependency on MS Visual C++ Redist. 2013. Now only Redist. 2015-2022
(multi-install) is required (thanks Khim for the help and patience)

===============================================================================

SSIMS-Flow v0.3.1.0

Major:
- GUI is now locale invariant, and will force the use of decimal dot (.)
regardless of Windows Regional Settings. When editing [project.ssims] file
manually, users should ONLY USE decimal dot (.) as a separator.

Minor:
- Replaced numpy.ctypeslib.load_library() with ctypes.CDLL() due to changes in
Python 3.8+ versions which cause a bug where a C++ libraries could not be
properly loaded. If the problem persists, please let me know.

===============================================================================

SSIMS-Flow v0.3.0.1

Minor:
- Add Normalize image filter
- Fix marker numbers not being deleted when using keyboard (D key)
- Add Threshold ratio 2D plot button

===============================================================================

SSIMS-Flow v0.3.0.0

Major:
- Applied pooling to temporal axis, which greatly improves the accuracy of time
averaging of velocity magnitudes
- Added automatic recognition of ArUco markers (default 4x4_50 dictionary)
in the first frame, which can be used for stabilization and orthorectification
(compatible with OpenCV 4.7+)
- Added option to delete unnecessary data after analyses (Delete data form)

Minor:
- Added "Load recent projects" option to main form
- Added option to only print time averaged optical flow data (to save space)
- Added option to only extract every Nth frame from the video
- Tweaks to Farneback method parameters to make it less sensitive to low displacements
- Fixed a UI bug when creating a new project in an existing folder non-empty folder
where previous folder would be mentioned in the pop-up Message Box
- Both time averaged (mag_mean) and local maximal magnitudes (mag_max) are now saved
and can be plotted in the Optical Flow Analyses form
- Fixed issues with Unicode support in config files

Update is NOT compatible with projects and results of releases 0.2.X.X.

Minor:
- Creating a new project will not delete the videos with extensions .mp4, .avi,
.mov, .mkv, .webm, and .wmv (case insensitive) from the project folder. It is,
however, not recommended to keep the video in the project folder.

===============================================================================
