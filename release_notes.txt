SSIMS-Flow v0.6.0.1

Minor:
- Removed minimal displacement filter from "Optical flow" form.
- Preselected profile in "Optical flow analyses" form will be shown in the plot
when using "Get profile from image".
- If the profile for flow rate estimation is defined in [project.ssims], either
manually or through previous analyses, profile data will be automatically
extracted upon the (re)estimation of velocity field to save some time.
- Bugfixes related to the 2D plotting when Scale!=1.
- UI tweaks and bugfixes.

===============================================================================

SSIMS-Flow v0.6.0.0

Major:
- Added Seeding Density Index (SDI) estimation in "Best frame sequence" tab.
This metric is developed by Silvano Dal Sasso and Alonso Pizzaro and explained
in detail in papers:
>> https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12111789
>> https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.13919
>> https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-5173-2020
>> https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126438
- SDI is developed and tested specifically for PIV workflows to allow users to
estimate optimal sections of the frame sequences in terms of tracer particle
seeding density to improve velocity estimation accuracy. While it hasn't yet
been tested with optical flow methods, it can serve as a starting point for
finding sections with adequate seeding density, regardless of whether SSIMS-Flow
or any other tool is used for velocity/flow rate estimation. Huge thanks to
Silvano and Alonso for helping me implement this workflow.
- All projects will now include folder called "SDI" which will contain diagnostic
results from the SDI estimation. This change is both backward and forward
compatible, meaning that projects created using older version can be opened
and used with the current version (v0.6.0.0), and vice versa.

Minor:
- Python library dependencies can now be installed with one click using the
"lib" button next to the Python interpreters dropdown in the main form. This is
done for the currently selected interpreted in the dropdown. Libraries already
installed will be updated to their latest versions.
- Project files can now be dragged and dropped into the SSIMS-Flow form to
load them. Only one file can be dropped at a time.
- SSIMS-Flow.exe can now be opened from CMD using the project file path as an
argument to load it upon start.
- Image enhancement and optical flow analyses can now be performed only for
the best frame window estimated using SDI analysis (if available). To enable
this option, check the box next to the "Enhance frames" or "Estimate velocities"
buttons in the corresponding forms.
- Added a more convenient way to add user defined filters. Instead of directly 
changing the [filters.json] and [filters.py] files, the users can now add custom
filters by defining them in the custom_filters.json file and providing an
appropriate script in [custom_filters.py] file. Check the original [filters.json]
for a guide on how to properly define a filter. Check the [filters.py] to understand
how to properly write a Python script for your custom filters. This change makes it
easier for users to migrate custom scripts between different SSIMS-Flow versions
without interfering with stock filters and scripts - just copy the
[custom_filters.json] and [custom_filters.py] files from old version to new one.
- New "Channel addition" filter for image enhancement, which can be useful when
dealing with spatially changing water turbidity (e.g., plumes).
- Sobel filter implementation changed from of scipy.ndimage.convolve to OpenCV
to try to improve performance with large kernels.
- Sorted filters into group in the "Add filter" dropdown of the "Image enhancement"
form. Filters are sorted using the new "Group" parameter defined in the
[filters.json] and [custom_filters.json] files. Use numerical prefixes to properly
sort the filter groups in the "Image enhancement" form.
- Added velocity filter in the "Optical flow" tab, which allows the removal of
results which fall outside the defined range. The filter uses pixels-per-frame
units, since the GSD is applied later in the "Optical flow analysis" form. To turn
the filter off, set the Min value to -1 or 0 and Max to -1, 0, or some very large
number. An appropriate hint is can be shown by clicking the "?" button next to
the filter boxes.
- Added a "quiet" cmd flag for the [filter_frames.py] script which allows for
uninterruptible batch scripting, similar to [optical_flow.py] and [profile_data.py].
See script file for more information.
- Added scripts [filter_frames_batch.py] and [optical_flow_batch.py] for automated
sequential processing of multiple projects. These scripts can provide faster way to
(re)process a large number of files without the need to manually open each one
through the GUI. See the scripts for explanations.
- Added a script [update_cfg_settings.py] to enable batch editing of project.ssims
configuration files for multiple projects. This can save time for projects which
have same parameter values, removing the need to edit each project through the GUI.
See the script for explanations.
- Added a hint for Alpha coefficient selection in the "Optical flow analysis" form,
available through the button labeled "?" next to the box.
- Fixed a bug where the filtering preview would sometimes fail on the first try
causing the "Image enhancement" form to hang until timeout.
- Fixed a slider behavior in "Image enhancement" form where mouse-dragging the
filter parameter slider causes the refresh of the preview on every single step
of the slider. The user can now freely drag the slider and the preview refreshes
only when mouse click is released.
- Fixed "Normalization" filter underflow and overflow issues.
- Replaced almost all occurrences of str.filter() with f-strings. This should
slightly increase performance when printing out diagnostics, but also makes this
and future versions incompatible with Python versions lower than 3.7. However, 
since Python 3.7 was released almost 7 years ago, it's time for us to move on.
- Other minor bugfixes and tweaks.

Major:
- Spatial pooling is now completely written in C++ and no longer relies on
block_reduce() from scipy. This also allows for around ~100 msec per-frame
speedup.
- Significant improvements to flow direction estimation accuracy, considering
that flow direction data is now also spatially pooled, i.e., calculated only 
based on the directions of magnitude-valid vectors within a pooling block.
- Added Reference frame pairing method.
- Added option to plot OF diagnostic data in Optical flow analyses form
- Added option to replace or interpolate data in the Optical flow analyses
table.
- Flow direction estimation accuracy significantly improved.

Minor:
- T0, T1, and T2 renamed to T1, T2, and T3. Projects created pre-v0.5.0.0
release should still work as intended without needing changes to file names.

- Minor changes to Optical flow form, now showing framerate calculations.
- Added Manual capping filter and fixed Normalize filter.
- If frames have been added by manually copying them in the frames/ folder,
a window asking for framerate will pop up before Analyze results form opens
in the Optical flow tab.

===============================================================================

SSIMS-Flow v0.4.2.0

Minor:
- Added velocity magnitude threshold filter
- Live plot preview is now optional during optical flow calculation (will save
around 200-300 msec per frame)

===============================================================================

Minor:
- Buxfix when 2D plots cause a "file not found" error with older projects
(pre v0.4.0.0) due to missing threshold_ratios.txt

===============================================================================

SSIMS-Flow v0.4.1.2

Minor:
- Fixed error in Preview filters

===============================================================================

SSIMS-Flow v0.4.1.1

Minor:
- Optical flow analysis will now show an overlay of the image used for
velocity estimation and the flow magnitude field, so that the user can track
what is being detected and tracked.
- Added support for taskbar progress indicator using PyTaskbar.
Requires comtypes (install with pip), and PyGetWindow (install with pip).
Is not required if you don't want/need a taskbar progress indicator.
Credits for PyTaskbar go to N3RDIUM (https://github.com/N3RDIUM/PyTaskbar).

===============================================================================

SSIMS-Flow v0.4.1.0

Major:
- Added an option to choose frame pairing method:
    a) Sliding frames by step (0>>step, step>>2*step, ...) = faster, less data
    b) Sliding frames by one (0>>step, 1>>step+1, ...) = slower, but more data

Minor:
- Improved background removal filter
- Modified filter preview form

===============================================================================

SSIMS-Flow v0.4.0.1

Minor:
- Bugfixes: colorspace conversions
- HSV colorspace now uses full 0-255 range for Hue, instead of 0-179

===============================================================================

SSIMS-Flow v0.4.0.0

Major:
- Reworked Image enhancement form, now opens in a new window with preview
- Image enhancement preview now uses native .NET forms, instead of Matplotlib.
This now allows for real-time preview of filter effects from the Enhance frames
form, without the need to restart Matplotlib figure every time.
- Optical flow now processes frames in pairs of (0, 0+OF_step), (1, 1+OF_step),
etc., where OF_step is the optical flow step. Previous versions used logic of
(0, OF_step), (OF_step, 2*OF_step), etc., which leads to fewer data points
in the final results.
- Added options to save filter stack to a file and load them from a file. This
should make it easier to reuse filter stacks across different projects, but
also allows for easier sharing with other people.

Minor:
- Minor bugfixes

===============================================================================

SSIMS-Flow v0.3.3.0

Major:
- Added Crop-to-ROI option in Unpack videos form
- Added Adjust Channels filter
- Required vcruntime140.dll now shipped with DLLs

Minor:
- Added a post-filtering colorspace indicator to the Enhance frames form.
Filter definitions now contain additional ColorspaceAfter parameter.
- Added a MEAN parameter to Gaussian lookup filter (previously fixed at 127)
- Apparently some changes were made to the way objects can be deleted in
Matplotlib 3.7+, causing deletion of certain object to fail. Should now
work correctly.

===============================================================================

SSIMS-Flow v0.3.1.1

Minor:
- Recompiled ssim.dll with MSVCR140.dll, now same as pooling.dll and filtering.dll
to remove dependency on MS Visual C++ Redist. 2013. Now only Redist. 2015-2022
(multi-install) is required (thanks Khim for the help and patience)

===============================================================================

SSIMS-Flow v0.3.1.0

Major:
- GUI is now locale invariant, and will force the use of decimal dot (.)
regardless of Windows Regional Settings. When editing [project.ssims] file
manually, users should ONLY USE decimal dot (.) as a separator.

Minor:
- Replaced numpy.ctypeslib.load_library() with ctypes.CDLL() due to changes in
Python 3.8+ versions which cause a bug where a C++ libraries could not be
properly loaded. If the problem persists, please let me know.

in the first frame, which can be used for stabilization and orthorectification
(compatible with OpenCV 4.7+)
- Added option to delete unnecessary data after analyses (Delete data form)

Minor:
- Added "Load recent projects" option to main form
- Added option to only print time averaged optical flow data (to save space)
- Added option to only extract every Nth frame from the video
- Tweaks to Farneback method parameters to make it less sensitive to low displacements
- Fixed a UI bug when creating a new project in an existing folder non-empty folder
where previous folder would be mentioned in the pop-up Message Box
- Both time averaged (mag_mean) and local maximal magnitudes (mag_max) are now saved
and can be plotted in the Optical Flow Analyses form
